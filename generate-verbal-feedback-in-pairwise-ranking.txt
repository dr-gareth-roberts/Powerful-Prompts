</persona>
---
<task>
An instruction (might include an Input inside it), two responses to evaluate (denoted as Response A and Response B), a reference answer, and a score rubric representing a evaluation criteria are given.
</task>
---
<instructions>
1. Write a detailed feedback explaining why {sub_str}, focusing strictly on the aspects highlighted in the evaluation criteria.
2. While writing the feedback, make comparisons between Response A, Response B, and the Reference Answer. Instead of examining Response A and Response B separately, go straight to the point and mention the commonalities and differences between them.
3. While writing the feedback, do not start by mentioning {sub_str} in the first sentence. Instead, generate a reasoning chain that delves into the commonalities and differences of the two responses and mention {sub_str} at the last part of your justification.
4. Within the feedback, do not explicitly mention the reference answer. For instance, do not use phrases like "Compared to the reference answer". It is assumed that you inherently know the reference answer which could be used to determine details that are not present in both responses under assessment.
5. Do not generate any other opening, closing, and explanations. Just write the feedback.
6. Within the feedback, generate a string phrase """[END]""" after you are finished.

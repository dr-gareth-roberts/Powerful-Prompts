    4. Phrase questions clearly and concisely (1-2 sentences each).

    Stage 3: Answer Development
    1. For each question, construct a clear, concise, and comprehensive answer (3-5 sentences).
    2. Include relevant evidence or examples from the text to support your answers.
    3. Make justified inferences where necessary, clearly labelling these as such.
    4. Ensure answers are self-contained and can be understood without referring back to the original text.

    Stage 4: Accuracy and Coherence Check
    1. Cross-reference your questions and answers with the original text to ensure factual accuracy.
    2. Verify that the set of questions and answers collectively cover the main points of the text.
    3. Ensure a logical flow in the sequence of questions and answers.

    Stage 5: Educational Value Enhancement
    1. Refine questions and answers to maximize their educational value.
    2. Ensure questions promote critical thinking and deep understanding of the material.
    3. Adjust the complexity of questions and answers to be appropriate for an advanced high school or undergraduate level.

    Stage 6: Self-Criticism and Refinement

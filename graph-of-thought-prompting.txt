<objective>
You are tasked with implementing the Graph of Thought prompting technique to explore a user's query or problem. 
Your goal is to create a comprehensive overview of the query by representing the central concept and other key sub-concepts as nodes, and the relationships between them as edges. 
You will then analyze this graph to gain deeper insights.
</objective>
###\n\n###
Here is the user's query:
<user_query>
{{USER_QUERY}}
</user_query>
###\n\n###
You are to determine the central concept for this Graph of Thought from the <user_query>.
<central_concept>
[A 10-15 word sentence that clearly and concisely states the central concept of the user's query for graph analysis]
</central_concept>
###\n\n###
<task_instructions>
Follow these steps to create and analyze your Graph of Thought:
1. Initial Nodes: Generate 5-7 key ideas, factors, or sub-concepts directly related to the central concept.
2. Node Expansion: For each initial node:
   a. Describe its relevance to the central concept
   b. Identify 2-3 sub-ideas, factors, or implications
   c. Consider possible challenges or opposing views
3. Edge Identification: Establish connections between nodes:
   a. Draw lines between related nodes
   b. Label connections (e.g., "influences," "enhances," "contradicts")
   c. Classify connection strength as strong, moderate, or weak
4. Cluster Analysis: Identify clusters of closely related nodes:
   a. Summarize the common theme for each cluster
   b. Explain how each cluster connects to other parts of the graph
5. Bridge Concepts: Identify nodes that connect different clusters and explain their significance.
6. Feedback Loops: Look for circular relationships and describe their influence on the central concept.
7. External Influences: Introduce and connect external factors that might impact your graph.
8. Temporal Dynamics: Consider how relationships or node importance might change over time.
9. Emergent Patterns: Identify and describe any unexpected relationships or insights that emerge from the overall graph.
10. Graph Refinement: Review and refine your graph by merging similar nodes, splitting complex ones, and adjusting edge strengths.
11. Alternative Perspectives: Consider how different stakeholders might view or modify the graph.
12. Solution Pathways: If addressing a specific problem, identify potential solution nodes and trace pathways to the central concept.
13. Knowledge Gaps: Highlight areas where you lack information or certainty.
14. Synthesis: Summarize key insights, influential nodes, and how your understanding of the central concept has evolved.
15. Action Steps: Derive and prioritize concrete actions or next steps based on your graph insights.
16. Reflection: Reflect on the process, unexpected connections, visualization benefits, and any limitations or biases in your graph.

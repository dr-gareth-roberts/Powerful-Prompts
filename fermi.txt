<example>
Here is an example with a full breakdown of answering a question using the Fermi estimation framework.
---
<question>
Two friends canoe upstream for 4 hours, only to realize that their campsite is downstream. They turn around and paddle downstream for 5 hours. The next day, they pack up and canoe back to their original starting point 23 miles upstream and arrive at 16:00. Assume that the river always flows at a constant rate of 2 miles per hour and
the two friends always paddle at a constant rate. What time did they leave for their return trip? 
Express your answer in the form hh:mm.
</question>
---
<planning>
OK-here's my plan. 
1. Rephrase the question
2. State key assumptions 
3. Break down the problem step-by-step
4. Verify critical information.
</planning>

<thinking>
<rephrasing>
<attempt_1>
Two friends canoe round-trip, starting upstream for 4 hours, downstream for 5 hours, then back to start. The return trip is 23 miles upstream, ending at 16:00. River flows at 2 mph. What time did they start the return trip?
</attempt_1>
---
<attempt_2>
[Hours upstream]↑[Hours downstream]↓[Miles upstream]↑[End time].[River speed]↓.?↑
Use provided values. Omit units. No spaces.
</attempt_2>
</rephrasing>
---
</assumptions>
- Constant river flow of 2 mph
- Constant paddling speed
- Round trip (same start and end point)
- 23 miles is only for the final upstream portion
</assumptions>
---
<problem_breakdown>
- Define variables
- Set up equations for upstream and downstream speeds
- Calculate total distance travelled
- Solve for paddling speed
- Calculate time for final 23-mile trip
- Determine departure time
</problem_breakdown>
---
<critical_information>
- 4 hours upstream initially
- 5 hours downstream
- 23 miles upstream for return
- Arrive at 16:00
- River flows at 2 mph constantly
</critical_information>
---
<reasoning>
1. Define variables:
   x = paddling speed in still water
   Upstream speed = x - 2
   Downstream speed = x + 2
2. Total distance equation:
    4(x - 2) + 23 = 5(x + 2)
3. Solve for x:
    4x - 8 + 23 = 5x + 10
    15 = x + 10
    x = 5 mph (paddling speed)
4. Time for 23-mile return trip:
    23 / (5 - 2) = 7.67 hours
5. Convert to hours and minutes:
    7 hours 40 minutes
6. Calculate departure time:
    16:00 - 7:40 = 08:20

<question>
Here is the Fermi question you need to solve:
<fermi_question>
{{FERMI_QUESTION}}
</fermi_question>
</question>
###\n\n###
<fermi>
Follow these steps to solve the Fermi estimation problem:
1. Initial Question Analysis and Rephrasing:
   - Carefully read and analyse the original question.
   - Rephrase the question in multiple ways to ensure full understanding.
   - Identify any hidden assumptions or implications in the original phrasing.
2. Question Reframing and Scope Definition:
   - Rephrase the original query, breaking it into core components.
   - Clearly define temporal, geographical, and conceptual boundaries.
3. Problem Decomposition and Visual Mapping:
   - Create a hierarchical breakdown of the problem.
   - Develop a mind map or flowchart illustrating relationships between components.
4. Assumption Articulation and Justification:
   - List all assumptions with clear rationales.
   - Identify potential biases in assumptions.
5. Multi-disciplinary Data Gathering:
   - Consult diverse sources across relevant fields.
   - Cross-reference data points for consistency.
6. Estimation Techniques Application:
   - Employ various estimation methods as appropriate.
   - Benchmark against known quantities when possible.
7. Calculation Execution and Documentation:
   - Perform step-by-step calculations using scientific notation.
   - Document each step clearly for later review.
8. Sensitivity Analysis and Error Estimation:
   - Identify key variables affecting the outcome.
   - Perform uncertainty quantification.
9. Cross-validation and Sanity Checking:
   - Compare results with known data or analogous situations.
   - Perform reverse calculations to verify logic.
10. Iterative Refinement Process:
    - Outline a structured approach for result improvement.
    - Define criteria for each refinement cycle.
11. Comprehensive Result Presentation:
    - Restate the original question and refined version.
    - Present the final estimate with confidence intervals.
    - Summarize key insights and potential applications.
12. Limitation Acknowledgment and Future Improvements:
    - Discuss known weaknesses in the estimation process.
    - Propose specific data or methodologies for future refinement.
13. Final Re-reading and Verification:
    - Re-read the original question.
    - Compare the final answer to each rephrasing of the question.
    - Verify that all aspects of the original query have been addressed.
    - Ensure the estimation process and result align with the intended scope.
14. Re-read the question AGAIN, reiteratively rephrasing like this for piano example:
    - Rephrase 1: Two friends canoe upstream 4 hours, downstream 5 hours, then 23 miles upstream to starting point, arriving 16:00. River flows 2 mph constantly. Friends paddle at      constant speed. When did return trip start?
    - Rephrase 2: Canoe trip: 4h upstream, 5h downstream, 23mi upstream to start. Arrive 16:00. River 2mph. Constant paddle speed. Return start time?
    - Rephrase 3: Canoe: 4h↑, 5h↓, 23mi↑. 16:00 end. River 2mph. Find start.
    - Final Rephrase: 4↑5↓23↑=16:00. 2↓. When↑?
15. Ensure that the final rephrase provides the same answer as step 13:
    - Evaluate the final rephrase problem.
    - Check its result against the two other solutions generated in step 11 and step 13.
    - If it matches, present the result to the user.
    - If it does not match, continuously re-iterate through these steps to find the flaw in your reasoning.
    - Once rectified, present result to the user.

<question>
How many piano strings are tuned annually worldwide?
</question>
---
<thinking>
1. Estimate global piano count:
- World population: ~8 billion
2. Assume 1 piano per 100 people
- 8 billion / 100 = 80 million pianos
3. Categorize pianos:
- 70% home: 56 million

- 10% professional: 8 million
4. Estimate tuning frequency:
- Home: 0.5 times/year

- Professional: 4 times/year
5. Calculate annual tunings:
- Home: 56 million * 0.5 = 28 million
- Institutional: 16 million * 2 = 32 million
- Professional: 8 million * 4 = 32 million
- Total: 92 million tunings/year
5. Strings per piano:

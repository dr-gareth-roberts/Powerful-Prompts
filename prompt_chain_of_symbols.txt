<Answer>
Let’s analyze the information provided step by step to determine if all yellow objects in Block C are above a blue thing:
<step-by-step-reasoning>
    1. C: (small, yellow, circle) ↑ (small, yellow, triangle)
    2. (small, yellow, triangle) = top of (medium, black, triangle)
    3. (large, blue, circle) ∞↓ (medium, black, triangle)
 Based on the provided information, C: (small, yellow, circle) ↑ (large, blue, circle) and (small, yellow, triangle) ↑ (large, blue, circle).

So, the correct answer is: "Yes".

<Answer>
Let’s break down the relationships between the objects step by step:
<step-by-step-reasoning>
    A: 1. (small, black, triangle) < (large, blue, circle)
       2. (large, blue, circle) < (small, blue, circle)
       3. (small, blue, square) ∞↓ (medium, yellow, square)
    B: 1. (small, yellow, circle) C: 1. (medium, black, triangle) < (small,yellow, circle)
       2. (small, yellow, circle) < (blue, triangle)
       3. (large, yellow, square) =↓ (small, yellow, circle)
       4. (large, black, square) ↓ (large,yellow, square)
Now, let’s determine the relation between the (large, black, square) and the (small, yellow, circle):
       1. C: (large, black, square) ↓ (large, yellow, square). Therefore, (large, black, square) ↓ (large, yellow, square)
       2. C: (small, yellow, circle) < (medium, black, triangle).Therefore, (small, yellow, circle) (medium, black, triangle)
So, the correct answer: "below" and "near to".

<Candidate Answers>["A", "B", "C"]</Candidate Answers>

<Answer>
Let's analyze each block step by step to determine which one does not have any objects touching its edge:
<step-by-step-reasoning>
A: 1. (medium, black, circle) ∞> (medium, blue, square)
      (medium, blue, square) > (small, yellow, circle)
      (medium, yellow, triangle) ∞↑ (blue, square)
      (small, blue, circle) ↑ (medium, triangle)
B: 1. (large, blue, square) => edge of B
      (medium, black, triangle) =< (blue, square)
      (large, blue, circle) ↑ (medium, black, triangle)
      (large, yellow, triangle) ↑ (large, blue, circle)
C: 1. (small, yellow, triangle) > (medium, black, circle)
      (yellow, triangle) => edge of C
      (small, blue, square) ∞< (medium, black, circle)
Based on the provided information, let's determine which block does not have any objects touching its edge:
 - Block A has no objects touching its edge.
 - Block B has the large blue square touching its right edge.
 - Block C has the yellow triangle touching its right edge.
So, the correct answer is: "A".

<Answer>
Let's break down the information step by step to determine which object is near the large yellow circle:
<step-by-step-reasoning>
A: 1. (large, black, triangle) ∞↑ (medium, black, triangle)
      (medium, black, triangle) ↑ (large, yellow, circle)
      (small, blue, circle) > (large, circle)
B: 1. (medium, blue, circle) < (small, black, square)
      (small, yellow, circle) ∞↓ (blue, circle)
C: 1. there is a small blue square

Now, let's analyze the position of the (large, yellow, circle):
    1. A: (large, yellow, circle) ↓ (medium, black, triangle)
       A: (small, blue, circle) > (large, yellow, circle)
---
Based on the provided information:
    A: (medium, black, triangle) ↑ (large, yellow, circle)
    A: (small, blue, circle) > (large, yellow, circle)

There are three blue shapes in a block that we call A.
Two medium blue squares are below a big blue square.
The first medium blue square is to the left of the other medium one which is touching the bottom edge of block A.
There is another block below block A we call it B.
A big blue triangle is touching the top edge of this block which is above a small black triangle, a big blue circle and a medium blue triangle.
The medium triangle is touching the bottom edge of the block.
The circle is below and to the left of the small triangle.
It is above the medium triangle.

<Candidate Answers>["Yes", "NO", "Do not Know"]</Candidate Answers>
---
<Answer>
Let's analyze the arrangement of objects in block B to determine if the small triangle is below the medium triangle:
<step-by-step-reasoning>
B: 1. (big, blue, triangle) = top edge of B
      (big, blue, triangle) ↑ (small, black, triangle), (big, blue, circle) and (medium, blue, triangle)
      (big, blue, circle) ↓< (small, black, triangle)
      (big, blue, circle) ↑ (medium, blue, triangle)
      (medium, blue, triangle) = bottom edge B
Based on the provided information:
- The small black triangle is above the big blue circle
- The big blue circle is above the medium blue triangle
Therefore, the small black triangle is above the medium blue triangle
So, the correct answer is: "NO".

4. Multi-Faceted Reasoning:
   <ReAct_framework>
   Thought: Reasoning step (reference context/analogies/reformulations/counterfactuals where relevant)
   Action: Propose an action (e.g., use a tool, request information)
   Observation: Outcome of the action
   </ReAct_framework>

   <Tree_of_Thought>

   - Generate multiple reasoning paths, informed by context, analogies, reformulated questions, and counterfactual analysis
   - Evaluate and prune paths based on likelihood of success
   - Synthesize insights from promising branches
     </Tree_of_Thought>

5. Tool Integration and Augmentation:

   - Leverage simulated tools (e.g., calculators, code execution) when beneficial
   - Clearly indicate tool usage and incorporate results into your reasoning

6. Self-Consistency and Verification:

   - Generate multiple reasoning attempts for complex problems
   - Cross-verify results and employ consistency checks
   - Implement Chain-of-Verification to validate critical steps
   - Ensure consistency with provided context, analogies, selected reformulated questions, and counterfactual insights

7. Adaptive Refinement:
   @{self_refine}

   - Continuously assess the effectiveness of your approach
   - Employ iterative improvement, refining your reasoning with each step
   - Utilize contrastive examples to highlight correct vs. incorrect reasoning
   - Refine analogies, reformulate questions further, or develop additional counterfactuals if needed to better address the problem

8. Uncertainty Handling:

   - Clearly communicate confidence levels in your reasoning and conclusions
   - Employ calibrated language to accurately represent uncertainty
   - Discuss how generated context, analogies, question reformulations, and counterfactuals affect certainty

9. Output Formulation:
   @{answer_engineering}

   - Ensure consistency in answer format and style
   - Provide a clear, concise answer followed by a detailed explanation
   - Use a mix of natural language and structured formats (e.g., markdown, pseudo-code) as appropriate
   - Explicitly reference how context, analogies, question reformulations, and counterfactual analysis contributed to the solution
